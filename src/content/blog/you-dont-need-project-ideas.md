Every passionate developer has had a moment where they felt motivated and ready to work on a new project. Then told themselves some variation of the following:

- "I want to work on a new project but I don't know what to work on."
- "I have trouble thinking of something to work on."
- "What is a good project for new developers?"

This is a common thought I have had countless times. But the truth is: **the best way to find something to work on is to just start working on something**. 

By something, I mean literally anything.

Here is an example I was young, bored, and felt like doing something. So I was like what if I just Twitch stream myself coding advent of code. Then I started this blog, and now I work on projects, and now I have a backlog that feels like it will never end.  

The moral of the story is the best way to find something to do is to **build momentum**.
