Hi! I am **Jaiden** and this is my about page.

I started this space because I wanted to build a digital presence for myself. I love programming and building things so I thought it would be a good idea to do it in public. 

I am a student with about a year of professional experience and a lot of free time until I graduate. As a Computer Engineer most of my work has been through software and web development, but I have a love for hardware as well.

I like to talk about tech, reading or whatever else comes to my mind. This website is more of a place for me to spill my thoughts than follow any particular agenda.
